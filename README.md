dont mind this, just learning how to use github
Amey here! A little new here. I'm pursuing engineering design in IITM currently. great university but no fun girls though i do hope i get to date chicks back in my insti maybe a white chick, oh god that'd be great. I look forward to go to europe, date a few girls before settling in with a classy chick. Now that I saw ur guide snaps, I wanna have tacos badly. LOL.
